**Task Manager**

This Python program is a simple task manager that allows users to perform various operations such as adding, editing, deleting, viewing all tasks, and filtering tasks by priority.

**Features:**

**Add Task**: Users can add a new task to the task list by providing details such as title, description, priority, and status.

**Edit Task:** Users can modify existing tasks by specifying the task ID and providing new details for the task. They have the option to update the title, description, priority, and status of the task.

**Delete Task**: Users can remove a task from the task list by specifying the task ID.

**View All Task**s: Users can view all the tasks currently in the task list, along with their details such as ID, title, description, priority, and status.

**Filter Tasks by Priority**: Users can filter tasks based on their priority level (High, Medium, Low) and view only tasks with the specified priority.


**Implementation:**

The program utilizes a Task class to represent individual tasks, with attributes such as task ID, title, description, priority, and status. 
Task management operations are performed through functions like add_task, edit_task, delete_task, view_all_tasks, and filter_tasks_by_priority.

The main function main() presents a menu interface to the user, allowing them to choose from various options to manage tasks. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
